# Job Shop Scheduling Problem 

This solution is done for meeting course requirements of **AE 476 - Industrial Engineering**, which is taught by 
[Dr. Girish  B. S.](https://www.iist.ac.in/aerospace/girish) in the fall semester of 2018 at [Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology](https://iist.ac.in). The problem is to find a generalized solver for the job shop scheduling 
problem

## Solution

*Note: The solution is now modified to run the case being discussed in class on 31/10/2018*

The solution can be found with explanatory notes [here](https://github.com/samvram/JobShopScheduling/blob/master/Job%20Shop%20Scheduling.ipynb).
You can also find the source only [here](https://github.com/samvram/JobShopScheduling/blob/master/JobShop.py).

## Platform used
The solution is devised on a python based platform which uses `ortools` from google api as the optimization package. OR-Tools is an open source software suite for optimization, tuned for tackling the world's toughest problems in vehicle routing, flows, integer and linear programming, and constraint programming.

After modeling your problem in the programming language of your choice, you can use any of a half dozen solvers to solve it: commercial solvers such as Gurobi or CPLEX, or open-source solvers such as SCIP, GLPK, or Google's GLOP and award-winning CP-SAT.
