Each job consists of a sequence of tasks, which must be performed in a given order, and each task must be processed on a specific machine. For example, the job could be the manufacture of a single consumer item, such as an automobile. The problem is to schedule the tasks on the machines so as to minimize the length of the schedule — the time it takes from when the jobs are first started until all the jobs are completed.\n",

For example, task(0, 2) and task(0, 3) are consecutive tasks for job 0. Since the processing time for task(0, 2) is 2, the start time for task(0, 3) must be at least 2 units of time after the start time for task 2. (Perhaps task 2 is painting a door, and it takes two hours for the paint to dry.) As a result, you get the following constraint:\n",
    "\n",
    "        t<sub>0, 2</sub>   + 2  ≤  t<sub>0, 3</sub>\n",
    "*    Disjunctive constraints — These arise from the restriction that a machine can't work on two tasks at the same time. For example, task(0, 2) and task(2, 1) are both processed on machine 1. Since their processing times are 2 and 4, respectively, one of the following constraints must hold:\n",

    "        t<sub>0, 2</sub>   + 2  ≤  t<sub>2, 1</sub> (if task(0, 2) is scheduled before task(2, 1))\n",

    "First, the program uses the solver's `FixedDurationIntervalVar` method to create `all_tasks`, an array containing the variables for the time interval of each task. This is a special type of variable in OR-Tools, called an interval variable, which contains both the begin time and end time for each interval.\n",
